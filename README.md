# Packing scripts:
1. def packing(self, box_dimensions=((0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1)), inclusion='CentroidIncluded'):
 A molecule which fills some multiple of the unit cell of the crystal.
 'CentroidIncluded' where whole molecules will be included if their centroid is within the box dimensions, and the default is to fill the unit cell.

2. csv = ChemistryLib.CrystalStructureView_instantiate(self._csv)
  psv = ChemistryLib.CrystalStructurePackingView(csv)
 ChemistryLib, I think it is from the CCDC Library, and I try to import it from CCDC Lib, but I don't know if it is correct or not. 

3. mol = ChemistryLib.Molecule3d_instantiate()
 This line initializes an instance of a 3D molecule object using the Molecule3d_instantiate method from the ChemistryLib library
4. for i in range(csv.nmolecules()):
        mol.add(csv.molecule(i))
    return Molecule(self.identifier, _molecule=mol)
 by iterating over molecules stored in a CSV-like object, adding each molecule to the mol object, and then returning a new Molecule instance that encapsulates this 3D molecular structure. 

My question is about the import CCDC Library and the number 4 part (for i in range...)
the script is from "https://downloads.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/documentation/API/_modules/ccdc/crystal.html#Crystal.packing"
# FAWCEN03 is one input MOF cif file.

# Docking scripts:
1. # Gold_multi_map and Gold_multi_queue1
2. these are two original scripts about docking 1 protein with many ligands, but they are too old.
3. # Gold_multi
4. the new scripts CCDC support give me, used for docking 1 protein with many ligands.
5. # Chatgpt modify could dock many MOFs with 1 amino acid (modify from  Gold_multi_queue1)
6. the scripts that I ask the Chat to modify it, and make it is possible to dock many proteins with 1 ligand. (but since it is too old, maybe we will not use it)
7. # Chatgpt modify from new scripts CCDC (and this is what I need your help to modify)
8. Chatgpt modify from new scripts CCDC support gave me, and also make it is possible to dock many proteins with 1 ligand.
9. # FAWCEN03_protein
10. the input MOF file
11. # glycine structure
12. the input ligand file
13. # gold
14. the gold configuration
