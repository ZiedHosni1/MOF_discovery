#packing script READme

1. def packing(self, box_dimensions=((0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1)), inclusion='CentroidIncluded'):
# A molecule which fills some multiple of the unit cell of the crystal.
# 'CentroidIncluded' where whole molecules will be included if their centroid is within the box dimensions, and the default is to fill the unit cell.

2. csv = ChemistryLib.CrystalStructureView_instantiate(self._csv)
  psv = ChemistryLib.CrystalStructurePackingView(csv)
# ChemistryLib, I think it is from the CCDC Library, and I try to import it from CCDC Lib, but I don't know if it is correct or not. 

3. mol = ChemistryLib.Molecule3d_instantiate()
# This line initializes an instance of a 3D molecule object using the Molecule3d_instantiate method from the ChemistryLib library
4. for i in range(csv.nmolecules()):
        mol.add(csv.molecule(i))
    return Molecule(self.identifier, _molecule=mol)
# by iterating over molecules stored in a CSV-like object, adding each molecule to the mol object, and then returning a new Molecule instance that encapsulates this 3D molecular structure. 

My question is about the import CCDC Library and the number 4 part (for i in range...)
and the script is from "https://downloads.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/documentation/API/_modules/ccdc/crystal.html#Crystal.packing"
FAWCEN03 is one input MOF cif file.
